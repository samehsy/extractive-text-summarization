### Data

* Symlink to your Raw data
    ```text
        user@host:/my/awesome/project$ ln -s /path/to/your/raw/data . 
    ```

* Data location must follow this structure:

```
data  
├── raw             <- Raw data
├── temp            <- transformed data stored temporarily if needed 
└── preprocessed    <- preprocessed data to run in a model
```
#### Data is immutable  
* Treat the data/raw (and its format) as immutable. Don't ever edit your raw data, especially not manually, and 
especially not in Excel.
* Don't overwrite your raw data. Don't save multiple versions of the raw data.
* The code you write should move the raw data through a pipeline to your final analysis.
* You shouldn't have to run all of the steps every time you want to make a new figure, 
but anyone should be able to reproduce the final products with only the code in lib/ and the data in data/raw.
